		Hi, I am Arafat. 
		I am an Artificial Intelligence researcher trying to help computers understand what we mean when we say something.
		So far they do this in their own unique strange way &#128579
		This branch of AI is known as Natural Language Processing (NLP) or sometimes Computational Linguistics.
		When there is no pandemic around, I work from my office at the <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/watson/">TJ Watson Research Center</a> in New York.
		Before NY, I lived in the beautiful city of Boulder, where I got my PhD in Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/cs/">University of Colorado</a> under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/ics/tamara-sumner">Tammy Sumner</a>.

		I am interested in the area of NLP called semantics, which applies computational methods to extracting meaning from natural language text.
		Over the years I have worked on some very interesting problems including identifying semantic similarities in sentences, question answering, automatic grading and adapting such algorithms for different domains and applications.
		At IBM, my research primarily focuses on question answering. 
		Most recently, I have been working on language generation models that can create synthetic training examples for QA.
