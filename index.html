		Hi, I am Arafat. 
		I work to help computers understand human language, which so far they do in their own unique way &#128579
		When there is no pandemic around, I work from my office at the <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/watson/">TJ Watson Research Center</a> in New York.
		Before NY, I lived in the beautiful city of Boulder, where I got my PhD in Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/cs/">University of Colorado</a> under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/ics/tamara-sumner">Tammy Sumner</a>.

		I am broadly interested in computational semantics, which applies computational methods to extracting meaning from natural language text.
		My research at IBM primarily focuses on question answering. 
		Most recently, I have been working on text generation models that can create synthetic training examples for QA.
		I have also worked on other interesting problems in the past including identifying semantic similarities in sentences and its application to problems such as QA and automatic grading, and finally domain adaptation and multitask learning of these tasks.
